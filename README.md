# cep_runtime
A runtime environment for CEP applications, written in Python.

Dependencies:
- Python 2.7 (currently most tools are incompatible with Python 3)
- naoqi-python

Run <i>cep.py id</i> for starting an application. <i>id</i> should be a number which identifies the application within the used data store (neo4j by default).

To explore the applications currently available in the data store, you can run shell.py.
